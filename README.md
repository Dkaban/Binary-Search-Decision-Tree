# Binary Search Decision Tree

### Language: Java
This is a demonstration of how to use a Binary Search Tree as a Decision Tree.
We import the text file, then traverse through the tree as indicated.

#### How it works
- BackPainAnalyzer.java and GamerAnalyzer.java are both driver classes using input.txt and input2.txt respectively.
- text file is imported
- each piece of the file gets a node
- nodes are determined by the bottom part of the files convention
- tree is traversed asking Yes or No (Binary option)
- Until a result is determined
